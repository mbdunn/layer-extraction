# layer-extraction

In this repository, we develop a method to extracting bioacoustic layers from active acoustic data. We focus on an algorithm that uses little computational power to accomodate large datasets from autonomous hydroacoustic broaband surveys.
Continuation of work developed during a Ocean Hackweek 2021 project - https://github.com/oceanhackweek/ohw21-proj-bioacoustics
